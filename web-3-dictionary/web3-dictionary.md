**DEX**: Decentralized exchanges like Uniswap.  

**Staking**: is the earning yield on your tokens.

**Metaverse**: is a shared virtual world where people meet up, buy NFTs, play games, or hang out.  

**Cross-chain**: the capacity to connect different protocols like a superhighway where all the cryptos have interoperability.
